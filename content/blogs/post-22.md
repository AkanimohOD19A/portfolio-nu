# *Building on our previous exploration of tree-based models (https://dev.to/afrologicinsect/tree-based-models-for-alzheimers-disease-classification-a-tidymodels-approach-136h), let's dive into ensemble methods and see how R makes it incredibly easy to build, deploy, and interact with sophisticated machine learning models.*

## Why Ensemble Methods Matter

Individual models are great, but ensemble methods often deliver superior performance by combining the strengths of multiple algorithms. In this post, we'll explore **model stacking** - a powerful ensemble technique that uses a meta-learner to intelligently combine predictions from multiple base models.

The beauty of R's tidymodels ecosystem is that building complex ensemble models becomes surprisingly straightforward, and deploying them through Shiny apps makes them immediately accessible to end users.

## The Ensemble Architecture

Our ensemble combines three complementary tree-based models:
- **Random Forest**: Excellent for handling feature interactions
- **XGBoost**: Powerful gradient boosting with high accuracy
- **Bagged Trees**: Robust variance reduction through bootstrap aggregation

These base models feed into a **Random Forest meta-learner** that learns the optimal way to combine their predictions.

## Step 1: Building the Base Models

```r
# Load required libraries
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)
library(xgboost)
library(ranger)
library(baguette)

# Create the preprocessing recipe
dct_recipe <- recipe(listening_time_minutes ~ ., train_df) %>% 
  step_corr(all_numeric()) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors())

# Define base models
rf_model <- rand_forest(mode = "regression", trees = 500) %>%
  set_engine("ranger")

xgb_model <- boost_tree(mode = "regression", trees = 500, learn_rate = 0.1) %>%
  set_engine("xgboost")

bag_tree_model <- bag_tree(mode = "regression") %>% 
  set_engine("rpart")
```

## Step 2: Creating Workflows and Cross-Validation

```r
# Create workflows for each model
rf_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(dct_recipe) %>%
  add_model(rf_model)

xgb_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(dct_recipe) %>%
  add_model(xgb_model)

bag_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(dct_recipe) %>%
  add_model(bag_tree_model)

# Set up cross-validation
cv_folds <- vfold_cv(train_df, v = 5)

# Train base models with cross-validation
rf_results <- fit_resamples(rf_wf, resamples = cv_folds, 
                           control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE))
xgb_results <- fit_resamples(xgb_wf, resamples = cv_folds, 
                            control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE))
bag_tree_results <- fit_resamples(bag_wf, resamples = cv_folds, 
                                 control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE))
```

## Step 3: The Magic of Stacking

This is where ensemble modeling gets interesting. We collect the out-of-fold predictions from each base model and use them as features for our meta-learner:

```r
# Collect predictions for stacking
rf_preds <- collect_predictions(rf_results)
xgb_preds <- collect_predictions(xgb_results)
bag_tree_preds <- collect_predictions(bag_tree_results)

# Create meta-dataset
meta_df <- train_df %>%
  mutate(rf_pred = rf_preds$.pred,
         xgb_pred = xgb_preds$.pred,
         bag_pred = bag_tree_preds$.pred)

# Define and train meta-learner
meta_model <- rand_forest(mode = "regression") %>% 
  set_engine("ranger")

meta_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_formula(listening_time_minutes ~ rf_pred + xgb_pred + bag_pred) %>%
  add_model(meta_model)

# Fit the meta-model
meta_fit <- fit(meta_wf, data = meta_df)
```

## Step 4: Packaging for Production

R's strength lies not just in model building, but in creating production-ready packages:

```r
prep_for_shiny <- function() {
  # Re-fit base models on full training data
  rf_final <- fit(rf_wf, data = train_df)
  xgb_final <- fit(xgb_wf, data = train_df)
  bag_final <- fit(bag_wf, data = train_df)
  
  # Create ensemble package
  ensemble_package <- list(
    base_models = list(
      rf_model = rf_final,
      xgb_model = xgb_final,
      bag_model = bag_final
    ),
    meta_model = meta_fit,
    recipe = dct_recipe,
    expected_features = train_df %>% 
      select(-listening_time_minutes) %>% 
      names()
  )
  
  saveRDS(ensemble_package, "TBM_ensemble_model.rds")
  return(ensemble_package)
}

ensemble_model <- prep_for_shiny()
```

## Step 5: Creating a Robust Prediction Function

```r
create_shiny_predictor <- function(ensemble){
  function(input_data){
    tryCatch({
      # Validate input
      if(is.null(input_data) || nrow(input_data) == 0){
        return(list(success = FALSE, error = "No input data provided"))
      }
      
      # Generate base model predictions
      rf_pred <- predict(ensemble$base_models$rf_model, new_data = input_data)$.pred
      xgb_pred <- predict(ensemble$base_models$xgb_model, new_data = input_data)$.pred
      bag_pred <- predict(ensemble$base_models$bag_model, new_data = input_data)$.pred
      
      # Prepare meta-features
      meta_features <- data.frame(
        rf_pred = rf_pred,
        xgb_pred = xgb_pred,
        bag_pred = bag_pred
      )
      
      # Final ensemble prediction
      final_pred <- predict(ensemble$meta_model, new_data = meta_features)$.pred
      
      return(list(
        success = TRUE,
        ensemble_prediction = round(final_pred, 2),
        individual_predictions = list(
          random_forest = round(rf_pred, 2),
          xgboost = round(xgb_pred, 2),
          bagged_tree = round(bag_pred, 2)
        )
      ))
      
    }, error = function(e){
      return(list(success = FALSE, error = paste("Prediction error:", e$message)))
    })
  }
}
```

## Step 6: Deploying with Shiny

The final step showcases R's incredible strength - turning complex models into user-friendly web applications:

```r
# Shiny UI with professional dashboard
ui <- dashboardPage(
  dashboardHeader(title = "Listening Time Predictor"),
  dashboardSidebar(
    sidebarMenu(
      menuItem("Single Prediction", tabName = "single", icon = icon("microphone")),
      menuItem("Batch Prediction", tabName = "batch", icon = icon("table")),
      menuItem("Model Info", tabName = "model_info", icon = icon("info-circle"))
    )
  ),
  dashboardBody(
    # Interactive prediction interface
    # ... (UI components for inputs and outputs)
  )
)

# Server logic with reactive predictions
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  ensemble_model <- reactive({
    load_ensemble_model()
  })
  
  predictor <- reactive({
    create_shiny_predictor(ensemble_model())
  })
  
  # Real-time prediction updates
  observeEvent(input$predict_single, {
    input_df <- current_input_df()
    result <- predictor()(input_df)
    
    if(result$success){
      prediction_result(result$ensemble_prediction)
      showNotification("Prediction completed successfully!", type = "message")
    }
  })
}
```

## The Results: Superior Performance

Our ensemble model achieved impressive metrics:
- **RMSE**: 13.3 minutes (vs. 13.4-13.9 for individual models)
- **R-squared**: 0.946 (vs. 0.745-0.760 for base models)
- **MAE**: 10.9 minutes

The meta-learner successfully learned to weight each base model's contributions, resulting in significantly better performance than any individual model.

## Why R Excels for ML Workflows

This project demonstrates several key advantages of R for machine learning:

1. **Unified Ecosystem**: tidymodels provides consistent syntax across different algorithms
2. **Easy Ensembling**: Combining models is straightforward with consistent APIs
3. **Built-in Validation**: Cross-validation and resampling are first-class citizens
4. **Seamless Deployment**: Shiny transforms models into interactive applications
5. **Robust Error Handling**: R's functional programming approach makes error handling elegant

## Interactive Model Exploration

The Shiny app provides multiple interaction modes:
- **Single Predictions**: Interactive parameter tuning with real-time results
- **Batch Processing**: Upload CSV files for bulk predictions
- **Model Transparency**: View individual model contributions and ensemble weights
- **Performance Metrics**: Built-in model evaluation and comparison

## Conclusion

R proves itself as more than capable for sophisticated machine learning workflows. From data preprocessing through ensemble modeling to interactive deployment, R provides a complete, production-ready ecosystem.

The combination of tidymodels for modeling and Shiny for deployment creates a powerful workflow that can compete with any Python-based solution while often being more accessible and maintainable.

Whether you're building simple predictive models or complex ensemble systems, R offers the tools and flexibility to go from prototype to production seamlessly.
